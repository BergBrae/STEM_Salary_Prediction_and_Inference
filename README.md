Brute force modeling pipeline to find good candidates for predicting salary. Includes permutation feature importance evaluation.

## Abstract and Introduction

With the extremely high level of competition between universities and institutions, sought out students and individuals find themselves in a high stress, highly intellectual industry where competition is fierce. Many students count degrees of graduate schooling and internship years on their resumes, which are often their ticket to certain competition themselves. As students--of any age--are encouraged to attend higher level university education and pursue increasingly furthering careers in their field of choice, a strong understanding of what is considered 'fair pay' within your industry is important. With people from many well-known, highly reputed institutions, there is still the reality that the number of years one spends in any position and the level of education they have obtained may not be the only factors determining compensation. This report takes a closer look into the role these attributes play in compensation within the STEM environment. An analysis of 4,608 models of varying methodology shows that these data and models can explain about 77% of the variance in salary as well as the factors that contribute towards it.
